# Ob2023

Obiettivo 2023 di Fabio Zuccaro utilizzo di vercel commerce per il solo obiettivo (di studio).

## Spiegazione progetto (TODO)

## MOCK

.env con MOCK=TRUE

## Running locally

For problem write to f.zuccaro@reply.it (problemi with file in .git and error of symlink on install)

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js Commerce. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control your Shopify store. --> FOR US IS NOT IMPORTANT WE DON'T USE SHOPIFY

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
npm install
npm dev
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
